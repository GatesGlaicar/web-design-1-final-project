        <h3>About Me.</h3>
        <img src="images/bio-pic.jpg" alt="">
        <p>
            My name is Gates Glaicar and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at Algonquin College.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through my studies, I have developed a solid foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as motion graphics and web design.
